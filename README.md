# City Builder Application

## Overview
This project implements an interactive city-building application featuring an isometric view where users can create and manage their own city. The application uses advanced design patterns to provide a flexible and extensible architecture.

## Project Description
The application simulates a city-building environment where users can place and manage various buildings and city elements on a tile-based grid. The project demonstrates software architecture principles that allow for easy traversal of city elements and operations on city components.

### Key Features
- Isometric city visualization
- Tile-based building placement
- Various building types and city elements
- Extensible architecture for adding new features
- Comprehensive element traversal system
- Flexible operations framework for city components

## Technical Implementation

### Grid System
The application implements a sophisticated grid system that allows for:
- Seamless traversal of city elements
- Custom classes for accessing grid elements sequentially
- Efficient methods to navigate the city structure

### Component Operations
The project features a flexible operations framework that enables:
- Performing various operations on city elements
- Specialized implementations for specific operations
- Support for complex operations on tiles and collections
- Building counter functionality

## Project Structure
- City Application: Main application framework
- Grid System: Implementation of the tile grid
- Component Classes: Building blocks of the city
- Operation Classes: Framework for city element operations
- Testing Framework: Validation of implementations

## Requirements
